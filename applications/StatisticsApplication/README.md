# Statistics Application

Statistics application consist of widely used methods to calculate statistics in various containers of KratosMultiphysics. There are mainly two groups of statistical methods namely **Spatial** and **Temporal**. **Spatial** methods calculate statistics on spatial containers and output the values whenever they are called. **Temporal** methods calculate statistics on the fly in a transient simulation. All the temporal methods gurantee that, the resultant statistics will be same as the ones if one calculates accumulating all the data upto that time instance and calculate the same statistics.
