TODO:
    - Nearest Element with Volume
    - Nearest Element tests
    - Test for Serialization
    - Test for local-search?
    - Unify (serial and MPI) and add test for Graph-indices-construction (... if it makes sense...?)
    - Serial: Construct Matrix Structure
    - Finish new tests => requires first implementation in core
    - Cleanup & remove old tests
    - Cleanup how the MapperParams are used
    - Cleanup how the AssemblyUtility is used (in Mapper-BaseClass)
    - Further cleanup Trilinos and try some things (read up on opt-stuff)
    - use std::unordered_set for row & column indices-vectors
    - For Trilinos: What happens if a rank does not have local nodes???
    - Function-Documentation
    - Delete copy and assignment-constructors
    - use explicit
    - testing => do some logical tests with CONSERVATIVE
    - MapperFlags: Check that they are used correctly and all of them are used in tests (CONSERVATIVE & USE_TRANSPOSE)
    - in search: use last_iteration...?
