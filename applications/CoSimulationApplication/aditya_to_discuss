IO => class or free fcts??? (probably class is better, otherwise the configuring of the IO is difficult.. And also e.g. we would not constantly open/close MPI-Ports)

how to do the allocation => particle

IO Empire => doubleVector???

Sync with myself? => do we allow this?

make all comm async ... => send first and then receive, probably best way to avoid deadlocks
=> can we make all communication async???

File-IO: Probably better to put files into a folder
    - If multiple external solvers are participating it is easier to keep track / avoid potential miscommunication
    - Should always be deleted at the beginning of a new simulation (and restart), otherwise old files might be read => much easier if files are inside a folder, then the IO can easily do it.

change name of settings being passed around in solver wrapper => has a subkey that is also called "settings"

think if the import/export in the synchronize can mess up the other classes (predictor, Acc, ConvCrit...)
