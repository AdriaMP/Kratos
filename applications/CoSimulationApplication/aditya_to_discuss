IO => class or free fcts???

how to do the allocation => particle

IO Empire => doubleVector???

Sync with myself? => do we allow this?

make all comm async ... => send first and then receive, probably best way to avoid deadlocks

change name of settings being passed around in solver wrapper => has a subkey that is also called "settings"

think if the import/export in the synchronize can mess up the other classes (predictor, Acc, ConvCrit...)
